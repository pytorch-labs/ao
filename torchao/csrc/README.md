# Custom C++/CUDA Extensions

This folder is an example of how to integrate your own custom kernels into ao such that
1. They work on as many devices and operating systems as possible
2. They compose with `torch.compile()` without graph breaks

The goal is that you can focus on just writing your custom CUDA or C++ kernel and we can package it up so it's available via `torchao.ops.your_custom_kernel`.


## How to add your own kernel in ao

We've integrated a test kernel which implements a non-maximum supression (NMS) op which you can use as a template for your own kernels.

1. Install the cudatoolkit https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cudatoolkit
2. In `csrc/cuda` author your custom kernel and ensure you expose a `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL` which will expose `torchao::your_custom_kernel`
3. In `csrc/` author a `cpp` stub which will include a `TORCH_LIBRARY_FRAGMENT` which will place your custom kernel in the `torchao.ops` namespace and also expose a public function with the right arguments
4. In `torchao/ops.py` is where you'll expose the python API which your new end users will leverage
5. Write a new test in `test/test_ops.py` which most importantly needs to pass `opcheck()`, this ensures that your custom kernel composes out of the box with `torch.compile()`

And that's it! Once CI passes and your code merged you'll be able to point people to `torchao.ops.your_custom_kernel`. If you're working on an interesting kernel and would like someone else to handle the release and package management please feel free to open an issue.

## Required dependencies

The important dependencies are already taken care of in our CI so feel free to test in CI directly

1. cudatoolkit so you can build your own custom extensions locally. We highly recommend using https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cudatoolkit for installation
2. manylinux with CUDA support. In your own Github actions you can integrate this support using `uses: pytorch/test-infra/.github/workflows/linux_job.yml@main`
