## Fused `int4 / fp16` Quant Matmul

Fused kernel that combines asymmetric dequantization and gemm. Useful primarily for compute-bound (M > 16) scenarios and not for memory-bound / inference scenarios.

The kernel fuses two ops:

- Dequantization: upcasts `u4 / s4` weights to `float16 / bfloat16`, followed by groupwise scaling and shifting by scales / zeropoints
- GEMM: matmul on dequantized weights and activations.

Tested and benchmarked for `HQQ` but could theoretically be used for any asymmetric quantization scheme.

> **NOTE**: Benchmark below is only indicative of performance on consumer-grade `Ampere` GPUs (`A6000` specifically). When tested on `H100`, the performance is on par / marginally worse than native / compiled `torch`.  
> The intended use is thus for fine-tuning / training models on non-datacenter GPUs (`80 <= compute capability < 90`). If interested in optimizing the kernel for other architectures, please drop a note in the CUDA-MODE Discord channel.

### Implementation Details

- Bitpacking is simple row interleave, no need for extensive preprocessing (e.g., `tinygemm` or `fastertransformer`)
- Tested for `float16 / bfloat16` activations, scales, and zeros
- Autotuned for both compute-bound and memory-bound configs
- Assumes operand B of the `gemm` is is the quantized type.
- Requires quantization along `in-features`, i.e., the `K` dimension, or `axis=1`, of `torch.linear.weight`.
- Implementation handles both transposed and non-tranposed quantized weights, useful for forward / backward training passes.

### Performance

Initial benchmarking (on `A6000`) demonstrates promising results, scaling well for compute-bound workloads:

- Times are in `ms`, see `benchmarks/benchmark_hqq.py`.
- `hqq_ref` is the base `HQQ_Linear` [module](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq/blob/6d50eee4bcdd99cc10716f1297c5b2803d2b6da4/hqq/core/quantize.py#L349) that is unfused (dequantization followed by call to torch.matmul).
- `tinygemm` calls `torch.ops.aten._weight_int4pack_mm`. Implementation is a custom HQQLinear layer that wraps the preprocessing necessary for this kernel, adapted from a benchmark script posted by @mobicham from `CUDA-mode` Discord discussions.
